                <p style="text-align: justify;">KILACHANDJI DEVCHAND founder of K.D. Polytechnic. <br>Kilachand was dubbed the greatest speculator of his time. Sometime around 1894 he was appointed guarantee broker to Louis Dreyfus & Company, a French export house in Bombay. It also gave him a broad and comprehensive experience in the oilseeds trade. From the beginning, Kilachand had visualized a future in oilseeds that would make him one of the best-known businessmen in Gujarat and Bombay. Till Kilachand entered the market, foreign firms such as Ralli Brothers, Volkart and Sassoon dominated the business. This changed with the establishment of Kilachand Devchand & Co. as a partnership in 1909, which was later incorporated as a private limited company in 1919 in the crowded business district of Bombay’s Masjid Bunder, which was then the hub of oilseeds and cottontrade. With time Kilachand Devchand & Co. became an eminent name as a cotton-trading firm and one of the largest exporters competing with the foreign firms operating in India.</p>
